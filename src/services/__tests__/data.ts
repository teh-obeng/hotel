          "The women staff at fresh restaurant were unhelpful and unfriendly. I booked for grand deluxe 2 bed bay view non smoking but they gave me a smoking grand deluxe room instead. The room stinks so bad my aunt and my mom and myself could not sleep. I have asthma, and that makes it more even worst. All night i have palpitations and could hardly breathe. And the chocolate in a small box that is suppose to be a welcoming gift was empty and whoever among the staff who took/ate the chocolate Had the decency to leave the wrapper inside the box. I'm not a big fan of those welcoming chocolate gift since i am not a chocolate freak myself but hopefully the hotel manager will read this and perhaps make him/her more aware and be more vigilant in checking or monitoring your staff activities. This is bad for business especially for foreign guests. This is a 4 star hotel...but the service is so poor and disappointing and I do not wish to come back into this hotel ever again.",

Being from Australia, where smoking is banned almost everywhere, it's a shame this place doesn't have enclosed space for smoking so the non smoking gambling people can breath without inhaling second hand cancerous fumes. This place really needs it and should realize there are a lot more non smoking gamblers than the smoking ones. The non smoking gamblers have more money as well.",

          'My husband and I have stayed in 5 star hotels around the world and this is definitely the best experience we have ever had. The hotel has recently been renovated and the styling is impeccable. The attention to detail is second to known. Club room - there was food available all day, buffet breakfast, light snacks, high tea, evening buffet. Complimentary bar until 10pm. The staff - were extremely attentive, always greeted you by name, made a point of remembering what sites you intended to visit. What your regular drink was. The main hotel bar - is out of this world style, staff, view and stock. The room - we chose deluxe room which is a large double room, sofa area, bureau area, 2 double wardrobes, bathroom with separate shower, twin sinks. The room view - we chose "city view" I wouldn\'t choose "Mount Fuji" as it can\'t be seen due to weather The location - Tokyo Midtown/Rippongi. This area has recently been developed, it is very central for all areas of Tokyo, high end designer shopping and Galleries etc. Metro - my husband and I spent a little time understanding the underground system and Rippongi is a major station so this made it easy for us to get around quickly if we didn\'t want a taxi. It happened to be my birthday during our stay, I think I mentioned it to a member of staff during our stay. On the morning of my birthday I was wished a happy birthday by every member of staff.',

          "This was the $1500 splurge on our last day in Japan. I wanted to have a view of Mt Fuji just like the photo in Expedia. We didn't get it. We got some other view. Besides, I didn't know it rains a lot and you often can't SEE Mt Fuji. I could have booked a five hundred dollar room. Second, I booked here for the 'Airport Transport'. It's NOT Ritz-Carlton. It's a Vendor. It BOOKS UP and it COSTS MONEY. I didn't get to enjoy Tokyo because it takes two hours to get to the airport (Three on the bus because it stops at other hotels) and a cab is three hundred dollars. The bus is thirty a person. I could have taken the train/metro but was afraid to get lost at the right terminal. So we sat at Narita for seven hours, three roaming around aimlessly before the United terminal opened. We had less than twenty-four hours in the suite--making the suite about $100 an hour. Yes it was fancy. Yes the staff was above and beyond (one got a Ramune for my son, and another made a beautiful origami). I don't know if people know it's a little scary to have people knock on your door at night--for Californians we get nervous. Breakfast was included and was excellent. Our sushi dinner was phenomenal! My main gripe was that in Japan, you are not expected to tip. But at the Ritz Carlton, the staff lingered as if they expected a tip. Three did. And the whole 'vibe' isn't our 'thing'...I don't like 'snooty', and everyone there was into that, especially the guests. Laguna Niguel one is super nice 100%",

We were 2 adults and 2 kids (13&10). So should be no penalty! In the end they waived the fee ‘out of courtesy’, like a huge favour to us! The hotel beds were super hard and uncomfortable! We’ve never had such uncomfortable beds in any of the hotels that we stayed before and we travel a lot for holidays every year! We all had back pains that next few morning! Location not that great!
